This PR implements the **Expert Review & Reassignment System**, a critical workflow for the Unhire platform. It also includes a comprehensive codebase audit and patch addressing security, reliability, and code quality.

## 🎯 Summary
- **Feature:** Full expert review workflow (submit draft → approve/reject → auto-reassignment).
- **Fixes:** 15+ reliability and security fixes across 14 files.
- **Audit:** Codebase cleanup and optimization.

## 🔧 Key Changes

### 1. Date Validation & Logic
- **Enforced Deadlines:** Added 3-layer validation (UI, Controller, Schema) to prevent projects with past deadlines.
- **Timer Fix:** `getProjectStatusService` now correctly calculates remaining time based on `assignedAt` (expert claim time) instead of `createdAt`.

### 2. Email Service Overhaul
- **Reliability:** Rewrote `email.service.js` with 3-attempt retry logic and exponential backoff.
- **Performance:** All email calls are now **non-blocking** (fire-and-forget) to ensure API responsiveness.
- **Configuration:** Added timeouts (10s connection, 15s socket) and lazy transporter initialization.
- **Fix:** Resolved a crash in `sendDraftApprovalEmail` where an ObjectId was passed instead of a user object.

### 3. Security Hardening
- **Ghost Token Guard:** `auth.middleware.js` now checks if the user still exists in the DB before authorizing.
- **Input Validation:** Added regex validation for email and min-length check for password in `auth.controller.js`.
- **Sanitization:** Added input trimming in `project.controller.js`.
- **Error Handling:** Added `try/catch` blocks in `profile.controller.js` and `admin.controller.js`.

### 4. Code Quality
- **Cleanup:** Removed unused imports and state in `PostProjectPage.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Changed `skills` in `user.model.js` from `required: true` to `default: []` to unblock client registration.
- **Consistency:** Standardized `req.user.id` usage across controllers.

## 🧪 Testing
- **Manual Verification:** Tested all flows via curl (see `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for details).
- **Validation:** Verified email retries by simulating SMTP failures.
- **Edge Cases:** Tested past deadlines, deleted users, and invalid inputs.
